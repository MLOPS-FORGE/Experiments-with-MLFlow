1. mlflow ui
2. write file1.py 
3. run python .\src\file1.py in powershell
4. log_artifacts also creates a new folder called mlartifacts 
5. if you delete any run from mlflow ui that doesnt delete from mlruns. (0 means default experiment)
6. to permanently delet a run in mlflow delet that folder in mlruns. that way it wont appear in ui also.
